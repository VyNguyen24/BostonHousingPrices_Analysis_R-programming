# RProject

In this project, we're using R to make visualizations and statiscal calculation to figure out which variables best predict housing prices from the Boston Housing dataset.  
Knowledge of the factors affecting higher prices will allow us to make informed financial decisions when assessing the values of households and their features. We can also determine which houses may be good investment opportunities.

Result: According to the models we created, the variables that affect housing prices the most are area, bathrooms, mainroad, and airconditioning. In the end, we were unsuccessful in creating a super accurate model, but we do have a great general baseline for which variables and factors affect price the most.
